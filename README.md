# Usage

* Clone this repository in your home repository
* `mv dotfiles .dotfiles && cd dotfiles`
* `./make.sh`

This will sync all dotfiles in this repository.

See http://blog.smalleycreative.com/tutorials/using-git-and-github-to-manage-your-dotfiles/ for the approach taken. This is very much a work in progress.
